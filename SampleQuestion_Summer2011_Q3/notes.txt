(i)		no default arguements were provided and too few were passed

(ii)	output is "100" and "14.1421".	100 is correct but 14.1421 is result from base class method. (base method ignores y value)
(iii)		set the base method to virtual and we call derived method which gives us "17.3205", which is correct	(derived method uses y value)
		Dyanamic binding means that the function call is bound to appropriate object at runtime; static is same but at compile time

(iv)	"cannot instantiate abstract class"		-reason: no implementation for getDistanceToWaypoint and base method is pure virtual

(v)		compiler doesnt know that pAI will hold an AirAI and so will only allow base AI calls

(vi)	the destructor is called when the method ends. the passed object shares the same memory address as the original, so its destructor corrupts the array

(vii)	

(vii)	"delete" only deletes first element in the array, the rest are left untouched. "delete[]" should have been used to delete all elements
